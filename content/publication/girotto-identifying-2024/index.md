abstract: Precipitation in mountain regions is highly variable and poorly measured,
  posing important challenges to water resource management. Traditional methods to
  estimate precipitation include in-situ gauges, Doppler weather radars, satellite
  radars and radiometers, numerical modeling and reanalysis products. Each of these
  methods is unable to adequately capture complex orographic precipitation. Here,
  we propose a novel approach to characterize orographic snowfall over mountain regions.
  We use a particle batch smoother to leverage satellite information from Sentinel-1
  derived snow depth retrievals and to correct various gridded precipitation products.
  This novel approach is tested using a simple snow model for an alpine basin located
  in Trentino Alto Adige, Italy. We quantify the precipitation biases across the basin
  and found that the assimilation method (i) corrects for snowfall biases and uncertainties,
  (ii) leads to cumulative snowfall elevation patterns that are consistent across
  precipitation products, and (iii) results in overall improved basin-wide snow variables
  (snow depth and snow cover area) and basin streamflow estimates.
