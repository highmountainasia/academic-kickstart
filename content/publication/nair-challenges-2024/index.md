abstract: Abstract Hydrologic assessment of climate change impacts on complex terrains
  and data-sparse regions like High Mountain Asia is a major challenge. Combining
  hydrological models with satellite and reanalysis data for evaluating changes in
  hydrological variables is often the only available approach. However, uncertainties
  associated with forcing dataset, coupled with model parameter uncertainties, can
  have significant impacts on hydrologic simulations. This work aims to understand
  and quantify how the uncertainty in precipitation and its interaction with the model
  uncertainty affect streamflow estimation in glacierized catchments. Simulations
  for four precipitation datasets (IMERG, CHIRPS, ERA5 Land, and APHRODITE) and two
  glaciohydrological models (GDM and HYMOD_DS) are evaluated for the Marsyangdi and
  Budhigandaki river basins in Nepal. Temperature sensitivity of streamflow simulations
  is also investigated. Relative to APHRODITE, which compared well with ground stations,
  ERA5 Land overestimate the catchment average precipitation for both basins by more
  than 70%; IMERG and CHIRPS overestimates by âˆ¼20%. Precipitation uncertainty propagation
  to streamflow exhibits strong dependencies to model structure and streamflow components
  (snowmelt, icemelt, rainfallrunoff), but overall uncertainty dampens through precipitation-to-streamflow
  transformation. Temperature exerts a significant additional source of uncertainty
  in hydrologic simulations of such environments. GDM was found to be more sensitive
  to temperature variations, with textgreater50% increase in total flow for 20% increase
  in actual temperature, emphasizing that models that rely on lapse rates for the
  spatial distribution of temperature have much higher sensitivity. Results from this
  study provide critical insight into the challenges of utilizing satellite and reanalysis
  products for simulating streamflow in glacierized catchments.
