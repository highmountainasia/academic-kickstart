abstract: The MERIT-Hydro networks re-gridded by the Iterative Hydrography Upscaling
  (IHU) algorithm do not retain exo- or endorheic basin attributes from the original
  data. Here we developed methods to assign such attributes to those and any other
  digital river networks. The motivation is that endorheic inland drainage basins
  are essential for hydrologic modelling of global and regional water balances, land
  surface water storage, gravity anomalies, sea level rise, etc. First, we create
  basin attributes that explicitly label endorheic and exorheic catchments by the
  criteria of direct or hidden connectivity to the ocean without changing their flow
  direction grid. In the second step we alter the delineation of endorheic basins
  by the merging algorithm that eliminates small inland watersheds to the adjacent
  host basins. The resulting datasets have a significantly reduced number of endorheic
  basins while preserving the total land portion and topology of the inland basins.
  The data was validated using the Water Balance Model by comparing volume of endorheic
  inland depressions with modelled water accumulation in their inland lakes.
