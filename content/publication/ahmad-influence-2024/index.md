abstract: This study was designed to characterize and quantify the influence of surface
  soil moisture assimilation on estimated runoff (surface flow and baseflow) and hydraulically-routed
  streamflow across three large river basins in South Asia that are at risk of impending
  water stress. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) surface soil moisture retrievals
  were assimilated into the Noah-MP land surface model. The gridded runoff was hydraulically
  routed to obtain volumetric streamflow values for a river network using a runoff
  routing module (Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform, HyMAP). The open loop
  (OL, model-only) and data assimilated (DA, includes soil moisture retrieval assimilation)
  Noah-MP runoff estimates highlighted the improvements in estimated total runoff
  across irrigated areas. Soil moisture assimilation impacted baseflow more relative
  to surface runoff. The HyMAP-based OL and DA streamflow generally underestimated
  the streamflow at upstream stations and overestimated the streamflow at downstream
  stations within the Indus basin due to missing physics related to reservoir operations.
  For stations located in the Ganges–Brahmaputra basins, the OL and DA estimation
  performance varied. The OL and DA results showed that the assimilation of soil moisture
  retrievals improves gridded runoff and volumetric streamflow across irrigated areas.
  Considerable relative change in streamflow (textgreater70% increase in magnitude
  relative to OL) is noted after assimilation across the highly irrigated lower Indus
  basin and high precipitation regions in Bangladesh. Improving the modeling system’s
  representativeness of ground conditions via inclusion of water management information
  could improve large-scale streamflow modeling across South Asia.
