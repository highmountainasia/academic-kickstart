abstract: Study region High Mountain Asia Study focus The study assesses five high-resolution
  gridded precipitation products against observations taken at twenty-seven weather
  stations across High Mountain Asia (HMA), one of the world's most complex and data
  scarce regions. Estimating spatiotemporal patterns of average and extreme precipitation
  in HMA is challenged by several factors, including the lack of ground observations,
  the diverse climate zones, and the sharp orographic gradients. Evaluating the quality
  and reliability of multi-source precipitation products before analyzing their trends
  and patterns is fundamental in such a region. A suite of high-resolution satellite-based
  product (the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations, CHIRPS,
  and the Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement,
  IMERG), model reanalysis precipitation estimates (European Centre for Medium-Range
  Weather Forecasts, fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis product, ERA5), and their
  blended product (ensemble mean EM and a localized probability matched mean, LPM)
  are evaluated on a daily scale from 2001 to 2008. The performance of each product
  is analyzed in relation to elevation, seasonal accumulation, and extreme indices
  (e.g., frequency of wet days and consecutive wet days). New Hydrological Insights
  for the Region Results show that reanalysis products present the largest overestimation,
  satellite retrievals the lowest, and ensemble productsâ€™ performance is encapsulated
  in between. LPM carries a high bias especially during winter when satellite estimates
  struggle to capture solid precipitation. The two ensemble products show higher correlations
  with the ground observations and smaller uncertainties in the error metrics than
  the original products.
