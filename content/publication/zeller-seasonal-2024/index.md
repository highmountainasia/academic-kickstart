abstract: Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) play an important role in debris-covered glacier
  (DCG) systems by enabling efficient interactions between the supraglacial, englacial,
  and subglacial environments. Developing a better understanding of the short-term
  and long-term development of these features is needed to constrain DCG evolution
  and the hazards posed to downstream communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure
  from rapid drainage. In this study, we present an analysis of supraglacial lakes
  on eight DCGs in the Khumbu region of Nepal by automating SGL identification in
  PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 5–9 images. We identify a regular annual cycle
  in SGL area, with lakes covering approximately twice as much area during their maximum
  annual extent (in the pre-monsoon season) than their minimum annual extent (in the
  post-monsoon season). The high spatiotemporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery
  (∼ daily, 3 m) shows that this cycle is driven by the appearance and expansion of
  small lakes in the upper debris-covered regions of these glaciers throughout the
  winter. Decadal-scale expansion of large, near-terminus lakes was identified on
  four of the glaciers (Khumbu, Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ambulapcha), while the remaining
  four showed no significant increases over the study period. The seasonal variation
  in SGL area is of comparable or greater magnitude as decadal-scale changes, highlighting
  the importance of accounting for this seasonality when interpreting long-term records
  of SGL changes from sparse observations. The complex spatiotemporal patterns revealed
  in our analysis are not captured in existing regional-scale glacial lake databases,
  suggesting that more targeted efforts are needed to capture the true variability
  of SGLs on large scales.
