abstract: Permafrost in High Mountain Asia (HMA) is becoming increasingly vulnerable
  to thaw due to climate change. However, the lack of either in situ ground surface
  or borehole temperature data beyond the Tibetan Plateau prevents comprehensive assessments
  of its impact on the regional hydrologic cycle and local cascading hazards. Although
  past studies have generated estimates of permafrost extent in Central Asia, many
  are limited to the Tibetan Plateau, excluding the more remote reaches of the Tien
  Shan, Pamirs, and Himalayas. By leveraging surface temperatures from both the Moderate
  Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS),
  this study advances further understanding of remotely sensed permafrost occurrence
  at high altitudes, which are prone to error due to frequent cloud cover. We demonstrate
  that the fusion of MODIS and AIRS products can accurately estimate long-term thermal
  regimes of the subsurface, with reported correlation coefficients of 0.773 and 0.560,
  RMSEs of 0.890 °C and 0.680 °C, and biases of 0.003 °C and 0.462 °C, respectively,
  for the ground surface and the depth of zero annual amplitude, during a reference
  period of 2003–2016. Furthermore, we provide a range of possible permafrost extents
  based on established equations for calculating the temperature at the top of the
  permafrost to demonstrate temperature sensitivity to soil moisture and snow cover.
  The MODIS-AIRS product is recommended to be a robust source of ground temperature
  estimates, which may be sufficient for inferring mountain permafrost presence in
  HMA. Incorporating the influence of soil moisture and snow depth, although limited
  by biased estimates, also produces estimates of permafrost regional areas comparable
  to previously reported permafrost indices. A total permafrost area of 1.69 (± 0.32)
  million km2 is estimated for the entire HMA, across 15 mountain subregions.
