abstract: Seasonal snow is an integral part of the global water supply and storage
  system. Snow droughts impact ecological, agricultural, and urban systems by altering
  the amount and timing of meltwater delivery. These droughts are characterized by
  a lack of on-the-ground snow (snow water equivalent, SWE) that can be caused by
  low total precipitation (dry drought) or low proportion of precipitation falling
  as snowfall (warm drought), often combined with an early melt. The standardized
  SWE index (SWEI) ranks the current status of SWE for a given location compared to
  a baseline condition and identifies the existence, but not the cause, of snow drought.
  In this work, we use estimates of SWE, temperature, and precipitation from nine
  coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 (CMIP6) models to quantify the frequency,
  severity, and type of snow droughts globally for historical and future scenarios.
  Compared to a historical baseline (1850â€“1900) total snow drought frequency more
  than doubles under socio-economic pathway (SSP)2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5; all of the increase
  in snow drought frequency comes from an increase in warm droughts. The probability
  distribution of future SWEI in major snowy basins around the world are likely to
  be centered on more negative values, which corresponds to more severe drought and,
  with only moderate changes in distribution spread, more frequent drought. CMIP6
  simulations pinpoint snow drought as an emerging global threat to water resources
  and highlight the need to explore higher resolution future models that better capture
  complex mountain topography, wildland fires, and snow-forest interactions.
