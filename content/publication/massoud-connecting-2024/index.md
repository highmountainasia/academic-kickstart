abstract: Oscillations in global modes of variability (MoVs) form global teleconnections
  that affect regional climate variability and modify the potential for severe and
  damaging weather conditions. Understanding the link between certain MoVs and regional
  climate can improve the ability to more accurately predict environmental conditions
  that impact human life and health. In this study, we explore the connection between
  different MoVs, including the Arctic oscillation (AO), Eurasian teleconnection,
  Indian Ocean dipole (IOD), North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), and El Ni√±o southern
  oscillation (Nino34), with winter and summer climates in the High Mountain Asia
  (HMA) region, including geopotential height at 250 hPa (z250), 2 m air temperature
  (T2M), total precipitation (PRECTOT), and fractional snow cover area (fSCA). Relationships
  are explored for the same monthly period between the MoVs and the climate variables,
  and a lagged correlation analysis is used to investigate whether any relationship
  exists at different time lags. We find that T2M has a negative correlation with
  the Eurasian teleconnection in the Inner Tibetan Plateau and central China in both
  winter and summer and a positive correlation in western China in summer. PRECTOT
  has a positive correlation with all MoVs in most regions in winter, especially with
  the IOD, and a negative correlation in summer, especially with the Eurasian teleconnection.
  Snow cover in winter is positively correlated with most indices throughout many
  regions in HMA, likely due to wintertime precipitation also being positively correlated
  with most indices. Generally, the AO and NAO show similar correlation patterns with
  all climate variables, especially in the winter, possibly due to their oscillations
  being so similar. Furthermore, the AO and NAO are shown to be less significant in
  explaining the variation in HMA climate compared to other MoVs such as the Eurasian
  teleconnection. Overall, our results identify different time windows and specific
  regions within HMA that exhibit high correlations between climate and MoVs, which
  might offer additional predictability of the MoVs as well as of climate and weather
  patterns in HMA and throughout the globe.
